### Articles

- [The Entire Netflix History of Us](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/fashion/modern-love-netflix-relationship.html) [The New York Times] -- A story of when a couple broke up and their shared Netflix account was the only remaining connection between them. I'm a fan of the [Modern Love](http://www.nytimes.com/column/modern-love) columns on NYT, because they explore the idea of love at levels and in contexts that are extremely thought-provoking. In many cases, they bring me agonizingly close to feeling painful emotions, but that is probably why I read them.

- [Dying Infants and No Medicine: Inside Venezuelaâ€™s Failing Hospitals](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/16/world/americas/dying-infants-and-no-medicine-inside-venezuelas-failing-hospitals.html) [The New York Times] -- I had no idea things were so bad in Venezuela. This article reports a disastrous failure of infrastructure in the country, under political instability and poor economic planning. In particular, hospitals seem to be very badly affected leading to growing mortality rates.

### Music
- Most of the good music I've recently discovered has been from Coke Studio, thanks to Soundcloud. Tum Naraz Ho is a soothing melody, while Shakar Wandaan Re is a very energetic composition.

### Miscellaneous
- I attended [commencement](https://twitter.com/nishanttotla/status/732313216768843776) this week as a Masters student. It was fun, especially since I couldn't attend the one after college.

- I'm going to Colorado next weekend! For more than two years now, I've really wanted to go there and never managed to. This time though, I took the initiative before a long weekend and I'm finally doing it! I'm also traveling with friends, something I don't do quite often.

- [#MyDepressionLooksLike](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MyDepressionLooksLike?src=hash) seemed to be trending on Twitter for a little while, with people describing their experience of depression. It was strangely reassuring.
