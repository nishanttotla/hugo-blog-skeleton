### Articles

- [The Day I Got My Green Card](http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-day-i-got-my-green-card-1467385905) [The Wall Street Journal] -- Amidst general gloom and doom, a rare positive story about immigration. Several people (immigrants and citizens) regularly face struggles here, when it comes to issues of inclusion and acceptance in an increasingly polarized world. If you read this though, you'll feel that a lot of luck was still involved in the outcome being positive, and it's hard to ignore the immense privilege the author has.

### Miscellaneous

- [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) -- A CMS for Hugo and Jekyll sites. I'll watch this closely, if it can deliver, because the simplicity of a CMS, combined with the power of static sites could be a huge win!
