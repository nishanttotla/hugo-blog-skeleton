I've had an extremely busy week and didn't find much time to do anything else. I considered not publishing a log this week, and merging it with the following week, but  `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

### Articles

- [Here Is The Powerful Letter The Stanford Victim Read Aloud To Her Attacker](https://www.buzzfeed.com/katiejmbaker/heres-the-powerful-letter-the-stanford-victim-read-to-her-ra?utm_term=.bwwlobVyk#.gsqJBEQDP) [BuzzFeed] -- An unconscious woman was raped by a 20 year old Stanford student behind a dumpster, and he was convicted but only got jail time of 6 months as punishment. This article is powerful, and has been evoking a lot of outrage over the awful treatment that rape victims are regularly subjected to, and the leniancy of the sentence. You've likely seen it shared everywhere.

- [The Medical Screenings All Men Need, and When](http://vitals.lifehacker.com/the-medical-screenings-all-men-need-and-when-1779846310) [Lifehacker] -- I've been considering figuring out a regular medical treatment plan (annual health checkup etc.) and this article seemed like a good starting point.

### Music

- Masala Coffee is a band from Kerala. I don't know much about them, except that this cover is beautiful.
