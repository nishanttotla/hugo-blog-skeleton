- [Why people pay to read The New York Times](https://medium.com/@lydiapolgreen/why-people-pay-to-read-the-new-york-times-60720880e707#.n7zkrugsv) [Medium] -- This is a brilliant point of view, and one that fully aligns with how I think of journalism in the digital age.

- [Former Facebook Workers: We Routinely Suppressed Conservative News](http://gizmodo.com/former-facebook-workers-we-routinely-suppressed-conser-1775461006) [Gizmodo] -- I've long believed that the algorithms run by giant tech companies have immense power when it comes to swaying public opinion, even if inadvertently. But if there's intent, things can get really tricky. It's okay to have biases in news reporting, and be explicit about them, but for people to believe that the content they read online is organic is dangerous if it's false. When viewed in conjunction with the above article, a few people at a few companies controlling the most used information channels sounds very dystopian, especially since accountability is suspect. Key lesson though? Get your news from multiple sources!

Finding an accepting partner can be extremely challenging as a disabled person, and this is a rare story on the topic. I wish it were longer, but good read nonetheless.
