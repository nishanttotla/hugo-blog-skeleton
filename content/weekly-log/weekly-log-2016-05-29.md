There isn't much to share this week because it's been a busy one, and I was away in Colorado all weekend. I'll publish a post about the trip soon.

### Articles
- [Why Google's victory in a copyright fight with Oracle is a big deal](http://www.vox.com/2016/5/26/11790878/google-oracle-fight-explained) -- A short summary of the background between the Google vs. Oracle case that's been all over the news. This includes the current status of the case and legal implications of either party winning. A good start if you know absolutely nothing.

### Music
- Shakar Wandaan Re again! Last week I shared the Coke Studio version, but it's also a song from the Pakistani movie called *Ho Mann Jahaan*. The movie version is more of a dance number, but still extremely likable and funky.

### Miscellaneous
- [AirHelp](https://www.getairhelp.com/en/) -- A website that helps you get rightful compensation when your flight is delayed.
- [Diversity and Inclusion at GitHub](https://github.com/blog/2176-diversity-and-inclusion-at-github) -- GitHub faced public criticism over harassment and poor work culture within the company, but have since worked hard to pull their act together. Good to see such a turnaround.
