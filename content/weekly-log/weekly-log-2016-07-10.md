### Articles

- [Experimenting with Post-Quantum Cryptography](https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/experimenting-with-post-quantum.html) [Google Security Blog] --

- [Dudes, You Have GOT To Stop Shaming The Women You Have Casual Sex With](https://www.buzzfeed.com/priyaalikaelias/shame-shame-pappi-shame?utm_term=.krvo1aEB3#.qtJO1obld) [BuzzFeed] -- A short article about how the idea that women can't really handle casual sex is just a stereotype. Women can certainly want casual sex, but some men can't seem to accept that fact.

### Movies and TV Shows

- [The Secret Life of Walter Mitty](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0359950/) -- I'd been wanting to watch this movie for a while now, and I did this week. The storyline is ridiculous and strange and makes no sense on one hand, but it was so beautiful and inspiring on the other. I would like to stick with the latter, and recommend it to you.

### Miscellaneous

- [ELI5: Why is it so controversial when someone says "All Lives Matter" instead of "Black Lives Matter"?](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3du1qm/eli5_why_is_it_so_controversial_when_someone_says/) -- For all the people who feel threateaned by the Black Lives Matter movement, and just keep repeating "All Lives Matter" in response, here's a great read, with a really simple analogy.

- [Pok√©mon Go](http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-go/) -- This is a new exciting augmented-reality game that I started playing this week. The idea is that you use your phone as a Pokedex to catch and battle Pokemon in the real world. Similar in principle to [Ingress](https://www.ingress.com/), which was launched more than 3 years ago.
