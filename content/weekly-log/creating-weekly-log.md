I recently got a cool idea from [Constantin's blog](http://thirld.com/blog/). On a more or less monthly basis, he writes about the books, podcasts, and other stuff he reads. I thought that this was great for two reasons -- firstly for keeping track of interesting things which are otherwise too easy to move past and forget, and secondly (for me) building motivation to actually find and engage with more such things, because I get to write about them!

So starting this week, I will try to write a weekly note on the books, articles, music, movies, websites, observations, and pretty much anything that comes up during the week. I'll try to publish on Sundays, but there's no pressure to stick to a strict schedule. We'll see how this goes!
