### Articles

- [Why Have Volcanoes in the Cascades Been So Quiet Lately?](http://www.wired.com/2015/05/volcanoes-cascades-quiet-lately/) [Wired] -- I have gradually become more and more fascinated with the [Cascade volcanoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Volcanoes) and the associated geological history. I found this article via Googling, and it briefly describes the Cascade subduction zone, following which it tries to analyze why the volcanic arc has been rather quiet lately.

- [Being queer in an IIT: ‘My time on campus left me scars to last a lifetime’](http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/being-queer-iit-my-time-campus-left-me-scars-last-lifetime-46749) [The News Minute] -- A man's account of how his life at an IIT (in the early 2000s) was painful due to the homophobic and heteronormative culture of the time. I don't think things were any different when I was at IIT Bombay, and feel sad for not speaking out against said culture. If you're interested, [here](http://orinam.net/student-response-campus-homophobia-bengaluru/) is another related article.

### Movies and TV Shows

- [Margarita, with a Straw](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2929690/) -- This is a movie about a girl with cerebral palsy, and it explores her sexuality. It's really rare to have a movie that treats disabled individuals like normal people with normal desires, and it's very refreshing. In addition, it's also a movie that explores homosexuality in a respectable way.
