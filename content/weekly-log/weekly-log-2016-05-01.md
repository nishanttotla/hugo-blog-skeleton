### Articles

The Pulitzer prizes were announced last week, and I'd been meaning to catch up on a couple of interesting articles that won. This week I could only do one.

- [The Really Big One](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one) [The New Yorker] -- This is a great piece of journalism, describing how the Pacific Northwest is due for a MAJOR earthquake. This is not one of your regular doomsday articles -- it goes through a great deal of background (made understandable for the non-expert) and history behind the tectonic activity in the region. It also describes how poorly equipped the region really is to deal with the consequences, and how things will go down if this earthquake hits in the next few years.

Then there were other nice articles that came up in my various feeds

- [Shields Down](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/shields-down/) [randsinrepose] -- Job resignations don't happen when you decide you're doing it. They happen when a certain event or situation leads you to lower your shields and consider the possibility of an alternative future.

- [Bored People Quit](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/bored-people-quit/) [randsinrepose] -- A post for engineering managers to detect boredom in their teams, and how to deal with it.

- [The Other Side of Diversity](https://medium.com/this-is-hard/the-other-side-of-diversity-1bb3de2f053e#.7ll31ndb5) [Medium] -- An old article by the awesome [Erica Baker](https://twitter.com/EricaJoy) describing her experience with how diversity in the workplace is also about helping marginalized groups build communities for themselves.

### Music

- Ali Zafar again üíúüíúüíú alongside Sara Haider, with this rendition of a beautiful song from 1963 sung by [Saleem Raza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saleem_Raza_(Pakistani_singer)). I've been sadder than usual this week, but listening to this song helped.

- I've also been letting Soundcloud just play suggested music in the background, and discovered some interesting stuff as a result.

James Blunt's "Your Beautiful" translated to Punjabi, pretty cool!

I discovered this acapella version of Strings' "Mera Bichra Yaar" two weeks ago, but found it again and really loved it.

I don't have (and didn't find out) much background about this track, but it's good nonetheless.

So far these suggestions have been üëåüëèü§òand I've just kept the tab open as an anytime go-to radio.

### Miscellaneous

- I subscribed to [Model View Culture](https://modelviewculture.com/) and hope to keep in touch with some extremely thought-provoking writings there. It describes itself as a magazine about technology, culture and diversity. Highly recommended!
