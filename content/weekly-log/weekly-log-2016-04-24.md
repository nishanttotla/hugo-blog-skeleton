### Articles
- [The Hidden Economics of Porn](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/04/pornography-industry-economics-tarrant/476580/) [The Atlantic] -- Some very intriguing insights about the porn industy by a gender-studies professor. The porn industry is really BIG, many big-name sites are owned by a single company (MindGeek) and contain pirated content. It's also very interesting to know that porn preferences of people are shaped by the keywords they use, which only reflect some stereotyped categories (that are often sexist, racist, or narrow-minded). Overall, the article contains several questions that ought to be asked about our relationship to porn and our consumption of it.

- [I am Alex St. Johnâ€™s Daughter, and He is Wrong About Women in Tech](https://medium.com/@milistjohn/i-am-alex-st-john-s-daughter-and-he-is-wrong-about-women-in-tech-4728545e7c0e#.o0x2dflzr) [Medium] -- A fitting reply to the misogynistic and regressive views publicly peddled by Alex St. John, by his own daughter Amilia. It's a well-written response that details her own experiences and why her father's views are misguided.

### Movies and TV Shows
- [Black Mirror](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/) -- It's a British TV anthology series that features speculative fiction with dark and satirical themes examining modern society, especially wrt the unanticipated consequences of new technologies. I started watching this week, and have liked it a lot.

### Miscellaneous

- [Camlistore](https://camlistore.org/) -- From the website, "Camlistore is a set of open source formats, protocols, and software for modeling, storing, searching, sharing and synchronizing data in the post-PC era. Data may be files or objects, tweets or 5TB videos, and you can access it via a phone, browser or FUSE filesystem.". I've been worrying about backing up my data for a while, especially with the amount of trust I currently need to have in Google or other third-party tools. I'll be following Camlistore closely.

- [Saving links to Google Inbox](https://gmail.googleblog.com/2016/04/inbox-by-gmail-better-way-to-keep-track.html) -- Google recently announced a Chrome extension for saving links directly into Inbox, and they get bundled too! This is an amazing feature since I did often use Inbox to do the same. [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) has serious competition! This also works on the phone app, although I didn't see bundling there.
