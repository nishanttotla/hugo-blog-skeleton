### Personal

I live in Berkeley, work at Docker in San Francisco. I used to be a Programming Languages PhD student at UC Berkeley, but dropped out in 2015.

I consider adventure to be a big part of my identity -- not only the thrill-seeking kind, but also the state of mind that allows me to lead a life of exploration. Some of this appetite is satisfied by [long-distance running and biking](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2749248), and [travel](/places). One of my long term goals is to attain enough financial independence to lead a life that primarily involves adventure in some capacity. At that point, I'll gladly give up my current one that involves hours looking at a computer screen every day.

Among other things, I enjoy playing music, reading, learning about new science and technology, and thinking about personal growth. I also support Arsenal Football Club, and drive stick shift.
