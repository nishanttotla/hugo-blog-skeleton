I was born in India and spent nearly 16 years of my life in one city, with a little occasional travel. I then spent 6 years away from home. In 2012, I moved to Berkeley, California where I lived for five years until moving to San Francisco in 2017.

In 2014, I made the commitment to self that I'd travel to at least one new country each year. Barring 2017, I've managed that so far. Here's a list of all the countries (non-transit) I've visited (upcoming trips in <font color="blue">blue</font>):
