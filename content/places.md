I was born in India and spent nearly 16 years of my life in one city, with a little occasional travel. I then spent 6 years away from home. In 2012, I moved to Berkeley, California where I lived for five years until moving to San Francisco in 2017.

In 2014, I made the commitment to self that I'd travel to at least one new country each year. Barring 2017, I've managed that so far. Here's a list of all the countries (non-transit) I've visited:

1. Mauritius (2004)
2. United Arab Emirates (2004, 2005)
3. Switzerland (2005, 2011)
4. Vietnam (2008)
5. Russia (2009)
6. Kazakhstan (2009)
7. Austria (2010, 2011)[^1]
8. Germany (2010, 2011, 2016)
9. Czech Republic (2010)
10. Italy (2010, 2013)
11. Vatican City (2010)
12. France (2010)
13. Belgium (2011)
14. Netherlands (2011)
15. United States of America (2012)[^2]
16. Mexico (2014)
17. United Kingdom (2015, 2016)
18. Japan (2016)
