I was born in India and spent nearly 16 years of my life in one city, with a little occasional travel. I then spent 6 years away from home. In 2012, I moved to Berkeley, California where I've lived since.

In 2014, I made the commitment to self that I'd travel to at least one new country each year. So far I've managed that, but here's a list of all the countries (non-transit) I've visited so far.

1. Mauritius (2004)
2. United Arab Emirates (2004, 2005)
3. Switzerland (2005, 2011)
4. Vietnam (2008)
5. Russia (2009)
6. Kazakhstan (2009)
7. Austria (2010, 2011)[^1]
8. Germany (2010)
9. Czech Republic (2010)
10. Italy (2010, 2013)
11. Vatican City (2010)
12. France (2010)
13. Belgium (2011)
14. Netherlands (2011)
15. United States of America (2012)[^2]
16. Mexico (2014)
17. United Kingdom (2015)

### Cities Visited

I also like to keep track of all cities that I've been to on a map. This of course doesn't include transit, but only actual cities that I set foot in.
