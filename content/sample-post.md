This is a sample post to demonstrate all the cool stuff that can be put inside a post on this blog. This is written in markdown, so all markdown syntax works, obviously. Let's look at **some notable things** that can be *done here*.

# H1 headers are pretty big

Code looks like `cmd <opt>`. You can also write blocks of code like
```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout<<"Hello World!"<<endl;
  return 0;
}
```
You can also write long commands that have a scrolll bar appear if they're too long
```
$ echo "super long command that takes arbitrary words as options for an executable called super to demonstrate that code blocks wrap around"
```
And then there's syntax highlighting with `< highlight language-name >` tags
{{< highlight bash >}}
$ echo "life is easier when you have syntax highlighting, but let's write a long line anyway, to see how text wrapping is dealt with"
{{< /highlight >}}

## Good spot for an H2

Moving on, what's a blog post without images? Here's how to add images to a post, with several features enabled. Go figure.
<figure>
    <img data-action="zoom" src="/images/nishant_seattle.jpg" style="width:80%;"></img>
    <figcaption>This is me in Seattle, March 2016</figcaption>
</figure>

Of course it's possible to link the image (or its caption to another page). The `<figure>` tags aren't necessary, and all styling works without them too, just in case you want to go down that path. What's nice about `<figure>` though is that you can use it to make image grids that share a caption. Cool right?

<figure>
    <img data-action="zoom" src="/images/sad-cat.jpg" style="width:48%; float: left"></img>
    <img data-action="zoom" src="/images/sad-cat.jpg" style="width:48%;"></img>
    <img data-action="zoom" src="/images/sad-cat.jpg" style="width:48%; float: left"></img>
    <img data-action="zoom" src="/images/sad-cat.jpg" style="width:48%;"></img>
    <figcaption>Someone please make this cat happy.</figcaption>
</figure>

The caveat is that you'll have to manually set widths so that it looks good, and aspect ratios need to match up if the grid is to render properly. At least this will work well on smaller screen sizes.

### H3 headers also get a line underneath

I love Twitter, so gotta be able to embed tweets inside posts. Hugo shortcodes won't align the tweet to center, so just use the Twitter embed code for now. Make sure to use `class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"` in the embed code.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gif search means I can instantly tweet a gif of a kitten eating its tail. <a href="https://t.co/Bsvez00Nhe">pic.twitter.com/Bsvez00Nhe</a></p>&mdash; Nishant Totla (@nishanttotla) <a href="https://twitter.com/nishanttotla/status/702604796822364160">February 24, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This is a foolproof method to embed any other content too, until I figure out a way create my own parametrized shortcodes.

Footnotes[^1] are immensely useful in blog posts and I often overuse them[^2].

#### H4 is rarely used, but for small sub-headings

Important things are more effective when said by famous people. Such as

<div class="custom-quote">
  <h1 class="icon-quote-left"></i></h1>
  <p>This coffee is terrible.<span class="author"> - Albert Einstein</span>
  </p>
</div>

That was a quote, but blockquotes are different like

> This is a simple blockquote. Text normally wraps around so that there's no scroll bar ever, which makes sense since this is not meant for code.

Finally, it's 2016 and emoji support is essential. Just pasting works! ðŸ˜¸ðŸ˜¸ðŸ˜¸
