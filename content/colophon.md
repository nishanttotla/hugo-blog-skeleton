This website is written using [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and compiled into HTML using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) - a static site generator written in [Go](https://golang.org/). The design is based on top of the excellent work by [Prakhar Srivastav](http://prakhar.me) using the minimalistic CSS framework called [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com).

Icons on the site are courtesy of [Fontello](http://fontello.com/). Typography uses [Source Sans Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro) and [Open Sans](https://github.com/FontFaceKit/open-sans).

Lastly, [Git](http://git-scm.com/) is used to publish on Github, where all the code for this website is freely [available](https://github.com/nishanttotla/hugo-blog-skeleton). Please feel free to contribute, via pull requests, issues, or any other way.
