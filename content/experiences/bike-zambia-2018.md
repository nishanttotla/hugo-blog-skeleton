> #### June 28 -- July 7, 2018 <i class="icon-flight"></i> 10 days

At the beginning of 2018, I had promised myself an adventure -- something that would be a personal
milestone after spending multiple years getting too comfortable and too unhappy in that comfort zone.
I wanted to do something new that I could look forward to with anticipation, and look back at with
fondness. This was also around the time that my friend Aadi was trying to convince me to sign up
for Bike Zambia, a 500+ km/6 day ride through Zambia on mountain bikes, part of an effort to raise
money for some local non-profits in Zambia.
In all honesty, I was
skeptical at first for two reasons -- I had stopped being interested in long endurance activities
mainly because I believed my body couldn't take it, and secondly, this was not only a huge
travel commitment but also required raising a substantial amount of money to support causes in
Zambia. Neither is a multi day bike ride very comfortable, nor is emailing friends and family
to ask for money.

After much deliberation that wasn't really going anywhere, I decided to sign up anyway, only to
end up on the wait list. Well great, at least I tried. A few weeks later though, I had to make a
decision once again when a spot actually opened up, at which point I was fairly excited and
convinced about it. And so here I was in late January, signed up for a 10 day Zambia trip
in the summer (or winter in the southern hemisphere). Apart from booking tickets and figuring
out logistics, I had to actually train for a multi-day bike ride (something I'd never done before)
and also raise $4000 by June. All this alongside my day job and having to figure out a job transition
that had been overdue as well. It wouldn't be until March-April that I would actually get started with
training or fundraising.

**Note:** This is going to be a long post broken down into logical sections. If a certain
part is uninteresting, feel free to skip to a different one. For convenience, here's a table of contents (click üîù on section headers to jump back up to this point):

### What is Bike Zambia About? [üîù]({{< ref "#table-of-contents" >}})

<figure style="float: left; width: 35%;">

</figure>

Simply put, Bike Zambia is a social effort organized by [Chooda](https://www.flipcause.com/secure/cause_pdetails/MTk0NzA=) based in San Francisco that raises money to support some local
organizations in Zambia.
As riders, 40 of us are tasked with raising a minimum of $4000 each *before*
the ride. This money is then donated to specific Zambian non-profits focused mostly on education
and HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention (a part of that money goes towards supporting ride logistics,
but riders are responsible for paying for their own travel and training). The bike ride itself
is a culmination of all these efforts -- a way to go out and see the work of these organizations
for ourselves, experience the country and engage with the people, and bring these back into our
lives to learn from and share with others. I should point out here that while I'm broadly supportive of charity efforts like these, I like to approach them critically for the simple reason that
sometimes they impose solutions on problems that shouldn't be solved by foreigners.
Having had this in mind,
it was important for me to know beforehand that the beneficiary organizations would be locally run, and
we'd also get an opportunity to see their work first hand. There would be more opportunities later
and especially during the ride to engage with these questions. Besides, I tried my best to get
money in through corporate donation matchings as well because corporations can't spend enough
money on charitable causes.

</figure>

To be 100% honest, I also had less than selfless goals in pursuing all of this. I've mentioned the desire
for adventure before, but the idea of potentially meeting some like-minded people and being
able to experience a new country in a way I would probably never do on my own were on my mind.
I have not only fulfilled these goals, but through Bike Zambia I've been gifted a lot of memories
and ideas that are going to shape how I think and behave.

### Early Impressions [üîù]({{< ref "#table-of-contents" >}})

I flew into Lusaka on June 28 (the capital city of Zambia) from Ethiopia, where I had
spent a week before the ride.
The idea was to spend a day in Lusaka visiting some organizations and get set up for the ride. The
ride itself would start on June 30 and end on July 6, with a rest day in the middle. Bikes were to
be provided by Mr. Yoram of Thorntree Safaris, our organizer on the ground in Zambia.
This was to be a supported ride -- we would sleep
in tents and our bags would be carried by a truck directly to the final destination, while some
vans would offer support on the way (food, water, medical). We would end up going to very remote
rural areas in Zambia. Villages that hardly see tourists and roads that aren't always on maps.

This trip was my first to mainland Africa, so there was a lot to see and learn. I'd already
experienced Ethiopia, so I was also looking to contrast that experience with Zambia. The visa
process (on-arrival for Indians) was pretty smooth and friendly. The largest bunch of Bike
Zambia riders arrived on the same plane, so the atmosphere was starting to build. The Zambian
winter was quite pleasant, chilly even, but the welcomes we got were more than warm.
I was more excited to see some Zambians welcoming returning family members with noise and fanfare
that I've only seen in perhaps a Desi movie before.

As we drove from Lusaka's Kenneth Kaunda International Airport to our campsite, the first thing that
stood out was how industrialized and Westernized Lusaka felt. There were strip malls, European
and American brands, and a marked lack of local flavor. To stretch matters further, there seemed to
be a proliferation of t-shirts associated with American entities. Don't be surprised if you see
someone wearing a Golden State Warriors jersey or a Penn State t-shirt. Why?
As I found out later, it's because apparently a large number of discarded/donated clothes
from America end up in these parts of Africa to be sold at throwaway prices. It not only looks
strange but also disrupts the local economy.

And then there were the large numbers of Chinese projects all over the country. In
case you didn't know, China is heavily investing in many African countries by building
infrastructure and giving out loans at zero to low interest rates. People in Africa,
seem to have mixed opinions, but China seems to be buying political support in exchange
for risky loans that few other companies or countries would give.
But that is a story for another time.

For two nights, we settled into Eureka Camp just outside the city. This is where we got set up
with our bikes and figured out logistics.

  <figcaption>Eureka camp was teeming with exciting wildlife! Zebras, Giraffes, Waterbuks, Monkeys, and several other animals frequently walked around our tents.</figcaption>
</figure>

On the first night itself, I was struck by how cold it was. While it was winter, I hadn't
expected the Zambian winter to be so chilly. I only had a thin sleeping bag which was clearly
insufficient, so after a night of extreme discomfort, I decided to buy a big blanket that would
keep me company for the rest of my time in Zambia. Honestly, the blanket was the only reason
I managed to sleep peacefully at night. Of course, waking up at 5am and getting out into
the cold never got any easier.

### Day 0 (June 29): Beneficiary Visits [üîù]({{< ref "#table-of-contents" >}})

On our first full day in Lusaka, we visited two of our beneficiaries doing remarkable work.

#### World Bicycle Relief

  <figcaption>Buffalo Bicycles is the company backing World Bicycle Relief. These bikes are quite robust and built to survive difficult terrain on and off road.</figcaption>
</figure>

[**World Bicycle Relief**](https://worldbicyclerelief.org/en/) is an organization that provides free bikes to school kids. This is very relevant in rural Zambia because schools are often very far away and kids either don't enroll as a result, or drop out because of the impracticality of just getting to their school (imagine walking 10 miles one way every day just to get to school as a 7 year old). This impacts girls even more, because they're expected to help out at home. The way World Bicycle Relief helps is by partnering with schools and donating free bikes (ones in the photo above) so that students who are most likely to drop out have a chance at completing their education. Bikes are also given out in a 30-70 boys to girls ratio, in order to compensate for the social norms that hold girls back even more. They also keep track of bike usage and school statistics, with renewals happening every four years if everything goes well. Although the fundraising done by us would mainly help World Bicycle Relief with education
efforts, their bicycles also help community health volunteers reach more patients and farmers to sell more goods. If there's one thing we would learn later during our ride, it would be that bicycles are
central to many Zambians' daily lives.

</figure>

#### Zambia Health Education and Communication Trust (ZHECT)

[ZHECT](http://www.zhect.org.zm/) works on AIDS awareness and prevention. They are trying to implement the 90/90/90 paradigm which is globally recognized -- it means that at least 90% of the population needs to be tested for HIV and know their status. Of those that test positive, at least 90% need to have started treatment. Of those who've started treatment, at least 90% should be sticking to it over a period of time. This is the recommended approach for controlling the epidemic spread, which is an issue in Zambia (1 in 8 adults is HIV positive).

<figure>
  <img class="lazy" data-action="zoom" src="/images/blurred-bg.jpg" data-src="/images/experiences/bikezambia/chilufya.jpg" style="width:100%;"></img>
  <figcaption>Chilufya Mwaba-Phiri (seated above), founder and CEO of ZHECT spoke to us about her vision and roadblocks to tackle. She also informed us about about programs like DREAMS (Determined, Resilient, Empowerd, AIDS-free, Mentored and Safe) and CSE (Comprehensive Sex Ed) that work at the school level, particularly focusing on adolescent girls and young women. What I loved about her was her precise articulation, grasp of nuances, and willingness to confront when necessary.</figcaption>
</figure>

ZHECT focuses on high-risk target groups such as men who have sex with men, sex workers, transgender individuals, who have a much higher rate of infection due to stigma and discrimination that makes it harder to access testing and treatment. They also focus on adolescents because there aren't too many other programs that do so. A lot of the effort is directed towards community support as well as providing free treatment.

  <figcaption>Brian Moonga (left), Zambia country director for World Bicycle Relief welcomes Nurse Joyce who works with ZHECT at the grassroots level.</figcaption>
</figure>

Yet another focus group for ZHECT is "serodiscordant couples" -- where only one of the partners is HIV
positive, where the goal is to ensure it stays that way. A team of nurses works at the grassroots
level to provide condoms, education, information about support groups, and train teachers in
schools. Treatment is always free and paid for by third parties. There are also counseling
efforts, such as encouraging HIV positive young people to play soccer which helps counter
feels of marginalization and suicidal tendencies.
Through years of effort, Zambia has
managed to get to a nearly zero percent infection rate for newborns, which is remarkable.
As a final note, it was eye-opening to learn about all these efforts first hand. In industrialized
nations, HIV/AIDS is no longer the death sentence it used to be a few decades ago, but it still is
in Zambia (and many other African countries), and so every effort goes a long way. Right from the
little 5 year old boy who challenged his pastor about abstinence[^1] to [Princes Kasune Zulu](https://www.lusakatimes.com/2016/11/07/hiv-positive-mp-challenges-fellow-mps-publicly-announce-status/),
the first Member of Parliament in Zambia to have publicly disclosed her HIV positive status and [helping fight stigma](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-38155771).

This had been a busy start to the day, so I spent the rest of it planning for the ride
and packing up. It was important to not waste too much time the next morning. That didn't stop
us from conducting a small dance party around the bonfire just before things got serious!

### Day 1 (June 30): Kafue to Mazabuka [üîù]({{< ref "#table-of-contents" >}})

<figure>
  <img class="lazy" data-action="zoom" src="/images/blurred-bg.jpg" data-src="/images/experiences/bikezambia/day-1-map.png" style="width:100%;"></img>
  <figcaption>Sample caption.</figcaption>
</figure>

This was it, day 1! We were transfered out of Lusaka and were about to start riding on some
field near Kafue. I felt a mix of excitement and nervousness because I knew I hadn't trained
enough, not to mention I was constantly getting injured when I pushed my body too hard. That said,
it was comforting to know that the explicit goal of this ride was not to compete but to
experience the country and talk to as many people along the way as possible. ~325 miles in 6 days
isn't an outrageous amount of cycling to do if one is reasonably trained and doesn't have particular
physical restrictions, but the challenge in this ride was really going to come from the off-road
terrain and perhaps weather changes.

<figure>
  <img class="lazy" data-action="zoom" src="/images/blurred-bg.jpg" data-src="/images/experiences/bikezambia/curt-bike.jpg" style="width:100%;"></img>
  <figcaption>Sample caption.</figcaption>
</figure>

The day started out fairly comfortably, I felt good on the bike and the excitement of just riding
in a new country was palpable. I tried to strike up conversations with people I passed on the
road with mixed success. Several were very forthcoming (particularly little kids), while others
were more reserved and happy with a quick greeting of "Muli Shani" ("How are you" in Bemba, the primary
language spoken around Lusaka). Soon after the first rest stop (maybe about 15 miles in), we left
paved road and got onto a dirt road. I should mention that over
half of Bike Zambia is on dirt or sand, which presents a unique physical
challenge. Biking in California may be hard because of the hills, but riding a mountain bike
over bumps for hours at a stretch can tire out the entire body. This is precisely what happened
to me, because by the end of day 1, I was ready to pass out and unsure how I would find the
strength to get up the next morning.

<figure style="float: left; width: 45%;">

</figure>

But before that, there was a lot more that happened during the day. It was cool to see the
enthusiasm with which the people of Zambia received us (remember that we were oddities --
a group of people in colorful clothes, majority of them white, riding bikes for no
practical reason. I don't disagree with that outlook.) and were curious to know where
we were going and why.

One of the highlights was meeting an extended family in their village and they wanting to show
us around. There were many other heartening interactions like that, and I also took photos
occasionally, but I felt constantly conflicted about our purpose there and we weren't
interfering in the lives of these people. Cultural exchange is a sweet thing but there are
always underlying power dynamics and a consideration of the impact visitors have on an area.
Perhaps another reason I felt uncomfortable was that some of the riders didn't quite
exercise restraint in taking pictures.
This would come up in discussion repeatedly throughout the ride.

A much more immediate concern for me on the day though was my left knee that had started to act
up. By around lunch time, it got bad enough that I couldn't ride without wincing in pain every
couple of minutes. This added to what felt like exhaustion made it all the more unpleasant.

<figure style="float: right; width: 50%;">

  <figcaption>Sample caption.</figcaption>
</figure>

I got my bike adjusted to help with the pain, and it did, but only to somehow trigger my right knee!
This meant that I ended the day with both my knees in trouble and feeling so tired that I was
ready to give up. To be honest, I kept questioning what I was doing out there on the ride when
I could instead be chilling on a beach in Thailand or something. I even kept playing through a script
in my mind on what it would be like to cut the trip short, what I would tell people who donated
to the cause etc. Of course I didn't and I'm glad about that, but I decided to be honest when I
wrote this trip log, because too often the tendency of travelers is to paint a very rosy
Instagram-friendly picture.

Anyhow, to put the pain in context, there were distractions and delightful moments when I had
the privilege of talking to Zambians on the road who were in the middle of their day, and
experience a snapshot of their lives which are very different (from my day to day in California),
and yet very familiar (from my experiences growing up in India). In return, they were also pretty
surprised and amused to learn we were doing this somewhat recreational ride, and rightly so
in my opinion.

<figure>

  <figcaption>Sample caption.</figcaption>
</figure>

As we arrived into Mazabuka, we met the deputy mayor of the town. He is a pretty active participant
in the fight against HIV along with ZHECT, whose volunteers were also present to receive us. I wish
I could have participated more in that discussion, but I was half asleep from exhaustion by that
point. Soon after, we finished 45 miles for the day and set up camp at Mazabuka Turf Club. Probably
half of that had been on bumpy dirt roads so my body had had a good shaking.

At the end of the day, I was just glad to have a hot shower, some warm food, and a place to sleep.

### Day 2 (July 1): Mazabuka to Monze [üîù]({{< ref "#table-of-contents" >}})

<figure>

</figure>

New day, new possibilities. I have no idea how I managed to get up early and get ready
after the last day. If you
know me personally, I often procrastinate a lot when it comes to packing and unpacking, but on this
trip it was "be ready by 7am or sit out". That pressure helped as I started to feel more efficient
with packing. The morning routine was elaborate, because it involved cleaning up and getting dressed
(bike jersey and bib), heavy breakfast, anti-malaria medication, sun cream, butt butter (go figure
out what this is), stretching, packing up bags and tent, and adjusting the bike if required.

Getting over knee pain was crucial, so I'd prepared by taking a ton (~800mg) of Ibuprofen[^2] the
previous night, massaging my legs, stretching, the works. I took 800mg more Ibuprofen in the
morning and hoped for the best. The first section started uneventfully, but a few miles in,
I was starting to doze off. Now that I think back, the Ibuprofen probably had sleep aid, which
I was too careless to notice. I was close to dozing off at multiple occasions,
until a big truck or two blazed past on the highway to give timely reminders of my fragility.

<figure style="float: left; width: 50%;">

  <figcaption>This group of villagers invited me to dance with them, so I did. Just what I needed to cheer up at the time, because my knees had started to sharply hurt by this time.</figcaption>
</figure>

Multi-day bike rides are funny because you notice all sorts of things you never do on a single day.
For instance, your butt gets really sore and it can hurt to sit rest on the seat. That gets better
as it numbs, only to start hurting again when you get up and try to sit back again. By day 3 or 4,
you just mentally adjust to it. I've heard better saddles can make a difference, so maybe one
day I will experience it.

I've mentioned before that Bike Zambia isn't super intimidating when you just look at the
distance and duration compared to other multi-day long bike rides. With sufficient training,
it's manageable for people with a wide range of backgrounds.
The real challenge comes from having to cross long off-road sections. Day 2 was the introduction
of the dreaded "sandy bits" (stretches of sandy trail) that honestly feel more like surfing
and less like biking (like with surfing, I did fall down a few times). Despite the difficulty,
I found these sections quite engaging and fun. On long road rides, I often find myself
getting impatient if it gets down to grinding out a long distance, one pedal after another.
On the sandy sections, none of that because one wrong move and down you go, so there was no
time to second guess or think. Plus sandy descents provide quite the adrenaline rush.

Sadly, my knees weren't going to cooperate on the day, and the pain got to a point where I had to
stop before lunch and couldn't complete the rest of the day. Bummer, because I had really started
to get in the groove. Still, there were some highlights like being invited to dance in a village,
followed by sugarcane at lunch (not in the village). I felt pretty sad for the rest of the day
because of this, and it probably showed on my face, although it was advisable to get some
rest to go with my cocktail of Ibuprofen.

On the plus side, spending some time in the car was fun because I got to take some nice photos
and connect with Mr. Greenwell, crew member who became friend (and one to nearly always wear
a wide smile). He told me about growing up in Zambia and his family back home, and many other
things about organizing the ride itself.

### Day 3 (July 2): Monze to Choma [üîù]({{< ref "#table-of-contents" >}})

<figure>

</figure>

We rolled out of the Moorings Lodge early in the morning and got on the highway (there's basically
one main highway that goes from Lusaka to Livingstone). The destination was Masuku Lodge near
the town of Choma. While the day was going to be a long one, the next day would be a rest day so there
was a ton of anticipation. Barring the last section of 20km, all of it was on road, probably the
longest road section in all of Bike Zambia. For me personally, it was yet another opportunity to
conquer my knee pain.

It started off pretty well for me, as I was able to ride fairly fast in the front of the pack.
The road was not very fun with all the trucks whizzing by, but I did see a funeral procession.
As common as funerals are, I realized I hadn't seen one in a long time, so it was kind of
hard-hitting. I decided it was best to just respectfully pass through and not bother people
in the procession.

Just before lunch, the knee pain hit again, and I thought it was prudent to just rest for
a bit, which I did. Before I stopped riding though, there were some nice experiences in a small
town on the way (TODO: find name?) where I got to talk to a couple of teenagers, bought some
souvenirs, and drank Fanta (I don't normally drink soda, but this day started my love affair
with Fanta and Sprite which lasted the rest of the trip).

</figure>

By this point, I had somewhat resigned myself to the idea of having to take breaks between
riding. Maybe my body wasn't meant for this kind of thing after all, so I decided to just
make the best of the situation and photograph other riders instead, for a bit. I also had a
chance to reflect on the interactions we'd had so far, such as the time when a guy asked for a
biker's watch in exchange for his goat. When it was pointed out that a goat would be hard to take
back to California, his simple solution was "don't go back to California". Or there was the time
when a kid wanted one of the bikers to go meet their teacher. Really fun stuff!

By the way, at this point we were firmly in Tonga land, having come far enough from Lusaka. That
meant our greetings changed to "Mabokabuti" ("Good morning" in Tonga), or "Mabuka" ("What's up?").
With the little kids who would run out to see the riders pass though, it was different. They
were more interested in pooling together their energies to yell "HOW ARE YOU" in sync and
perfect rhythm, often not interested in a response. This was quite cute when it happened, and the
times when I got to ask "How are you" first, the response would be abrupt and clear - "FINE!".

Come evening, my knee started feeling better and I was itching to ride again, so I decided to
just jump in. Unknown to me, it was going to be one of the toughest sections of all, a constant
sandy patch leading into Masuku Lodge where we were to finish the day. Whatever followed
was nothing short of what I'd call a miraculous recovery -- I not only finished the section
without pain, but was one of the first ones to do so. Along the way, I discovered that for a
beginner I was rather good at mountain biking. Even though I fell a couple of times (one of those
was caught on video apparently), I was pretty happy and satisfied at the end of day 3 -- finally
a day that ended on a high note. I finally started to feel a little at home and stopped thinking
about being on a beach in Thailand. Oh and thanks to my skills on the sand, I got a cheesy
nickname too -- "Nisand". Whatever you say, the human body is capable of miracles sometimes,
even if it frustrates often.

I felt simultaneously relaxed and full of energy that night, kind of like after an exam. Watching
the world cup games and looking at the stars was wonderful and made extra pleasurable by the company
of two over-friendly Labradors at the lodge.

### Day 4 (July 3): Rest Day at Masuku Lodge [üîù]({{< ref "#table-of-contents" >}})

Rest is best. Getting a day off between hard efforts is always welcome. For us, it meant we could
sleep in a little (get up at 6am instead of 5), not have to rush to get into gear and pack up
our clothes, and also explore the town, something I hadn't had a chance to do until that point
in Zambia.

</figure>

We spent the morning doing a birdwatching tour near the lodge. I've never really had any
inclination to go seek out birds, much less photograph them, but perhaps this small excursion
had started to change that. Of course, we saw beautiful birds such as the [Lilac-breasted Roller](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bm4az1gBr-6/), or rare ones, such as [Chaplin's Barbet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplin%27s_barbet) which is only found in a small part of Zambia. There was also some
Impalas and other wildlife, but overall I found my impressions of birding and bird photography
changing.

</figure>

Getting back into the lodge, I rested hard. Which is to say that I had a lot of tea and soda (separately of course)
lounged around, dressed up in nicer clothes, played with my camera, talked to people -- everything
that I would normally do on an actual vacation. Later on, a small group of us headed into the town
of Choma. Our friend Raul convinced us that "the best Indian restaurant in Zambia" was in Choma,
so we found the only Indian restaurant in Choma and went there. I had missed more familiar food
and I was craving some flavors (after Ethiopia, Zambian food had been disappointing).
As I proclaimed that it was pretty average Indian food, Raul broke the news
that the entire story was a setup -- he hadn't even known there was an Indian restaurant in
Choma! Safe to say that after this prank, he would not be trusted with travel recommendations üòÉ.

### Day 5 (July 4): Batoka to Lake Kariba [üîù]({{< ref "#table-of-contents" >}})

</figure>

After a rest day, this was supposed to be a relatively shorter ride to get us warmed up again. It
would also be a ride that wouldn't get us closer to Livingstone, because we were supposed to spend
one more night at Masuku Lodge. Early in the morning, we got a transfer out to the town of Batoka,
and from there we began the ride to Lake Kariba. I had a poop emergency (thankfully the only time
during Bike Zambia) and it was interesting finding a place to go early in the morning. It worked
out üòÉ.

Lake Kariba is a huge man-made lake and reservoir,
situated along the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. Even though this was supposed to be an easier
ride, it was an opportunity for me to gain some more confidence, so I generally pushed hard. The
route was both scenic and there were long descents which made it quite thrilling too. We finished
the ride around lunch, and I managed to do it with zero pain, so this was for me the point
where I 100% believed I belonged here and could finish the rest of the ride. I was further
buoyed because Zambians on the way seemed extra cheerful and called out multiple times for me
to join them, which I did on a couple of occasions. It's no surprise, but making more stops is
much easier when you're in front and not under pressure to catch up with the rest of the group.

</figure>

At the lakeside, I paid for a much needed massage and had some fries (have I mentioned that
I craved fries and soda all the time during this trip?). Then, we were transferred back to Masuku
Lodge.  Oh and we also celebrated one of the rider's (Mike) 70th birthday that night, which meant
cake and ice cream after a while!

During the day, I had a long conversation with our ride leader Henk about why we even do this
ride as opposed to just raising money and staying home. I will address that towards the end of
this post.

### Day 6 (July 5): Choma to Kalomo [üîù]({{< ref "#table-of-contents" >}})

</figure>

We finally said goodbye to Masuku Lodge and biked across the town of Choma to head towards a
long stretch of deep sand. Slated to the hardest section of the entire ride, it lived up to
its reputation. Soon we got off the road into a sandy section that I felt pretty comfortable on,
overall.

<figure style="float: left; width: 45%;">
  <img class="lazy" data-action="zoom" src="/images/blurred-bg.jpg" data-src="/images/experiences/bikezambia/village-kids.jpg" style="width:100%;"></img>

  <figcaption>Sample caption.</figcaption>
</figure>

Following that, we got onto a long off-road stretch that seemed to last forever. Despite
a little pain on and off, I was able to get through it without much of a need to stop. I also
rode this part mostly alone, with some occasional company from Nick (one of the riders).
Later on, we got into a really deep sand section on which it was hard to go even 20 feet without
having to stop. The thing about riding through deep sand is that you need to pedal really hard
and fast, maintain firm grip on the handlebar, and have a lot of faith. Firm grip and faith I
can manage, but I can only pedal hard for so long before fatigue kicks in. Still, it was
an enjoyable challenge and I'm glad my body cooperated.

A fun thing about this day was that we met a man (TODO what was his name?) in the afternoon
who was patiently waiting for the group of riders to arrive. Apparently, he does this every year,
preparing for the riders and planning in advance to be ready to receive them -- all because
he likes the work that the fundraising supports. He also has a personal connection to some of the causes,
because he runs educational and housing facilities for HIV positive kids.

In the evening, we got a nice little reception as we entered the town of Kalomo. I felt at least
a little accomplished and really excited by the fact that we weren't going to sleep in a tent!

<figure style="float: right; width: 45%;">

  <figcaption>Sample caption.</figcaption>
</figure>

We checked into a tiny hotel, which even though it wasn't fancy by any means, was such a big upgrade
over sleeping in tents that it felt like the ultimate luxury. It's all relative I guess. The extra
space also allowed me to have a nice long chat with Dave (my tent mate so far) and we connected
over several similar life experiences. Oh and it was great having to not compete over showers
because each room had its own shower with unlimited hot water, can you believe it! I suppose the
only thing that went wrong was that my suitcase fell out of the van at some point because the
hatch opened on a super bumpy road. Thankfully everything inside (including my camera) was intact,
though the bag now has permanent scars. Makes for a nice story though.

### Day 7 (July 6): End of Ride at Victoria Falls [üîù]({{< ref "#table-of-contents" >}})

At the start of the last day, my confidence was high and I was looking forward to finishing the
ride strongly. We got a transfer out of Kalomo to put us onto the highway to Livingstone.

<figure style="float: left; width: 35%;">

  <figcaption>Above and middle: My getting ready to dance, and then trying to do it. Bottom: With Malenga and Luiz, employees of DREAMS. They're both in their early 20s.</figcaption>
</figure>

The last day was overall a short ride, mostly on road. Just outside Livingstone, we got a wonderful
welcome from some employees and volunteers of DREAMS (Determined, Resilient, Empowerd, AIDS-free, Mentored and Safe), a grassroots organization. They presented some Zambian dance forms (I have
sadly forgotten the name, but I'm trying to find out), and taught a couple of brave
volunteers (me one of them) some moves too! We got on our bikes again and reached City Hall in
Livingstone, where the mayor greeted us. He even organized a police convoy to lead the ride
out of town. Livingstone was the biggest town we were in after Lusaka, so it was nice to be back
into an urban area. Being close to Victoria Falls and the national parks in the vicinity,
Livingstone is a huge tourist center. It also has several remains from the colonial era.

The ride wasn't over yet. We biked outside town, right past a gigantic herd of wild elephants
who were just passing by on the side of the road! A little further, we stopped at the banks of
the mighty Zambezi river, where we got the first peek at the massive mist rising in the
distance (Victoria Falls!). From that point, it was a short ride to the Zambia-Zimbabwe border.
We passed through the Zambia border checkpoint to head into the zone between the two countries (it
is possible to come back as long as you don't enter the other country). The light drizzle at this
point was unmistakable. During July, Victoria Falls is in heavy flow and the resulting mist waters
a large surrounding area. Five minutes from there, we rode on to the famous Victoria Falls bridge --
a bridge between the two countries and directly over the Batoka gorge that carries water from the
falls downstream.

</figure>

Here we lied squarely on the boundary between drizzle and light rain, so powerful were the falls.
Heading on the bridge on a bike was a surreal and scary experience because it's only when you're
on the bridge and somewhat exposed that the scale of the spectacle really hits you. The bridge
railing isn't terribly high, and you can see rainbows when you look down. And it was in the center
of the bridge that the ride had officially finished. Congratulations and high fives were
followed by some celebratory champagne. It felt wonderful to finish what I had come for.

As the fact sunk in, we indulged in a regular tradition -- the Victoria Falls bridge is a popular
bungee jumping spot -- so many people try it after the ride.

</figure>

I had never bungee jumped before, but was fairly confident I wanted this time to be my first.
I think I no longer have the youthful daredevil attitude, but then on the flip side I fully
experienced the fear and nervousness, which is what you pay for anyway right?

I did not only the bungee jump but also a swing across the gorge. Honestly, the latter was scarier
as my face in one of the photos will amply demonstrate.

</figure>

The day ended with a walk down the Mist Trail near the falls, which is a good way to experience its
full force. The Mist Trail is aptly named because the strong mist hides even the sun, and to stand
on the trail is to experience torrential rain.

After such an eventful day, I can confidently say that I had the best hot shower and dinner in a
while. I had been lucky to experience a slice of life that had tuned me to find immense happiness
in small daily activities. My time in Zambia was coming to an end and there was only one day
of activities to go. The hard work though, was done!

### Day 8 (July 7): Beneficiary Visit and Farewell [üîù]({{< ref "#table-of-contents" >}})

Grassroots Soccer is a cool organization that leverages the wild popularity of soccer in Zambia to educate and protect kids from AIDS. Typically, kids are trained in groups to prepare them for regular tournaments. Coaches are certified health educators who along with training also educate kids and encourage them to get tested, because knowing your HIV status is the first step towards protecting yourself and others. For those who do test positive, there are ways to access free treatment, for which also Grassroots Soccer helps. These kids in the picture above are just about to play as a team in the tournament that we visited on our final day in Zambia. It was an incredible party atmosphere with a lot of local participation. Grassroots Soccer trains both boys and girls. From talking to the organizers, we learned that being engaged in training helps kids stay away from drugs or risky sexual decisions, as well as makes it easier to broach the subject with them because coaches are trusted by parents.

These kids were quite good, although some teams were clearly way better than others.

On a side note, a lot of medication (usually generics) is manufactured in India, and is significantly cheaper than similar medication in the US for instance. One of our fellow riders works for an organization that helps distribute cheap/free medication to poorer nations, and I learned a lot from talking to him as well.

After the soccer tournament, we had some time to kill in Livingstone. It was such a joy
getting a latte and fried food sitting on a comfortable coffee shop couch! I also had time to
shop for some Chitenges (traditional waist wraps typically worn by women in that part of Africa)
and generally explore the colorful local market.

We finished the evening with a lovely sunset cruise on the upper Zambezi, where lots of photos were taken
and goodbyes said. It had been quite an adventure, but for now, this was my last day in Zambia.
The next couple of days I would travel to Zimbabwe before heading home to India.

#### Ethical Considerations While Taking Photos

There have been many photos so far of people in Zambia, and I've tried hard to be ethically conscious while clicking these. For starters, photos of all individuals have been taken with explicit verbal or gestural consent. Even so, I've also tried to make efforts to talk to them and know their stories. There's a fine line between clicking photos of locals for exhibitionism versus being genuinely interested in their lives and taking photos for remembering memories. It's hard to always get it right, but my focus has always been to act in Zambia like I'd act anywhere else in the world when showing consideration for the people and culture of the land. I am happy that several people shared my concerns and were open about this, but I was also disappointed by the more heavy handed attitudes of some other people. While it is undeniable that the money raised by the ride will do a lot of good, there are several questions I have been mulling over since. While there was no way I could have formed connections with so many Zambians had I not done this ride, it is also true that perhaps we were shielded from a lot of dark truths because of our support team. Again, these are debatable topics and I'm going to explore them further when I write that blog post (or if you want to chat in person).

ALSO MENTION WHY THIS RIDE MAKES SENSE WRT FUNDRAISING. (Day 5)

TALK ABOUT SHARING FOOD (Day 6)
What about begging? What about villagers standing there? Share food?

The Biking
Zambia is not an easy country to ride in ‚Äî the experience varies a lot. There have been tough unpleasant parts as well as extremely joyful ones. I‚Äôve had some bad luck with unexpected knee pain during the ride (due mostly to muscle tightness) but with sufficient breaks, pain-killers, and lots of help from our amazing crew, I‚Äôve managed.  There are still three days of riding left after today to get to Victoria Falls. For me personally, riding on challenging long off-road sections on a mountain bike has been a source of great thrill and learning. We‚Äôve also biked on sand, which honestly often feels like surfing (like surfing, I fell a couple of times). Locals in the villages we pass through have been extremely welcoming and  cheerful ‚Äî kids see us and exuberantly shout, people share their life stories, make offers to buy our bikes, take us to their huts to meet their family, enjoy clicking photos together, sometimes add us on Facebook. It‚Äôs also been good getting to know other riders and learning their stories.

[^1]: Brian Moonga told us this true story of his pastor pushing abstinence as the only way to fight infection in one of the church ceremonies. It's been well known for a while that abstinence-only education is insufficient, but the pastor wasn't willing to listen. Then a 5 year old boy got up and asked, "but what if only teaching abstinence doesn't work?". The pastor said "of course it always works", to which the boy replied "even Michelin tires are advertized to not burst, but they still burst. Then what?". The pastor didn't have a response. (This story is paraphrased from my memory, which is based on Brian's memory, so this is only a gist).
