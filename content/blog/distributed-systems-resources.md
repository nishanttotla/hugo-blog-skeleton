I started working on distributed systems in early 2016. Given that I had little to no background, I started trying to cover as much as possible from the literature out there.

In this (dynamically updated) post, I intend to keep track of all good resources I come across in this quest. This includes not only research papers and books, but also good blogs, people to follow and discussions/meetups that could be helpful. It’s overwhelming to begin with, but everything that’s worthwhile has to start somewhere! This is obviously not a complete list, but hopefully the union of content within all entries on the list will be complete.
