During my time growing up in India, I always associated the word "ritual" with religion.
Indeed, almost all contexts where the word came up were related to religion or its
practice in some form. In particular, I saw several Hindu rituals from a young age. Some
of them seemed rather unremarkable, while others seemed genuinely painful and
difficult for the people involved. Looking back, I would even go on to say that
some rituals are downright discriminatory or oppressive. This is a view that many young
Indians share today, especially those who question the role of religion in
furthering social divides. I was fortunate because I never had to participate in these
things to any significant extent (thanks to my parents), but "ritual" was still the
dirty word that most progressive young Indians were supposed to avoid.
But that is not what this post is about.

When I moved to the US five years ago, the personal freedom I experienced in my
initial days here was unlike anything I'd known before. The lack of structure around
my day (made more prominent because of grad school) and the lack of things
I was "supposed" to or "expected" to do meant that I had to create a new way of life from scratch. Turns out, it wasn't easy, or even enjoyable for that matter.
It is safe to say that most of my time in this country has been
plagued by wide-ranging personal issues, only exacerbated by the lack of a strong
and consistent social circle. As I've found my footing in the last few months or so,
I have come to revisit the idea of "rituals" -- not in a religious context[^1], but more
of a personal and social one.

"what I will do in SF?"

[^1]: My views on religion have softened over the last few years, even though I'm not religious myself. I still cannot support oppressive practices, but I can see why the practice of religion gives meaning to many people's lives. That's a topic for another day.
