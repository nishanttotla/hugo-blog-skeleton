I started a full-time job in 2016, and one of the things that hit me was how little vacation time I had -- 3 weeks a year of PTO (paid time off)[^1], and that includes sick leaves etc. I believe that 49 weeks a year (give or take) are too much of my life to give to any company unless maybe it's my own. This is because I have many other personal goals that aren't achieved by writing code, so I need time beyond it. Some companies offer "unlimited" PTO, but it's [unclear how well that works](http://www.inc.com/gene-marks/why-unlimited-paid-time-off-is-bad-for-your-employees.html). LinkedIn calls it [discretionary PTO](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/linkedin-unlimited-vacation-time_us_561c007be4b0e66ad4c8c015), but it's the same thing.

Several software companies (including mine) are more generous around their employees structuring their working days though, and working remotely if necessary. Still, the expectation to show up and be productive exists, and it's not the same thing as true time off[^2]. Given this, I'm really interested in learning about how my peers in related fields do it, especially the ones who manage to push limits. So I decided to interview people and write about it. I hope this content is useful for many others who have the same question.

Questionairre:

- Where do you work, and for how long?
- What's the official vacaction policy at your company?
- Does your company allow you to work remotely?
- What do you normally like to invest time in, outside of work, and how much time does it need?
- How much vacation do you actually take? Do you feel it's enough for you?
- How do you manage expectations?

[^1]: I understand that I'm already privileged to have a very generous job that gives me a lot of flexibility. Still, given that my job is not my identity, I want to push the limits. Besides, given that I live a 30-hours each way journey away from my family, I generally need more time to be able to see family AND pursue my own goals.

[^2]: I want to clarify that I think it's quite alright to not have a tight separation between "work" and "life" all the time. In fact, that's the only way modern creative jobs can be managed, but that's a discussion for another post.
