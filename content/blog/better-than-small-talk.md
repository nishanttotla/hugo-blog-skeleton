Last weekend, I attended an interesting event called [Better Than Small Talk](http://www.betterthansmalltalk.com/#end-small-talk). From the website, here's a brief description

> Better than Small Talk is a community gathering for people who want to move past repetitive small talk and explore more meaningful conversations.

It was a cool gathering of people from various backgrounds with one simple goal -- to have deep conversations in a setting that facilitated it. This meant no small talk or discussions about mundane day to day stuff. I've known this about myself for a while now, but I absolutely love a good conversation in a relaxed setting. In college, there was a lot of time for those. Friends were close and easy to reach. The story after graduating has been quite the opposite though, perhaps more so because I don't get to regularly meet friends, and making new ones is significantly harder as many people discover sooner or later. So when [Kat](https://twitter.com/KatVellos) told me she was organizing this event, I was immediately on board[^1].

I must clarify -- I don't believe that small talk is bad or unnecessary. In fact, it often serves as a gateway into deeper conversations. But often, people are reluctant to move past it, in which case it can become exhausting. Could an experimental event where everyone gathered to avoid the small talk actually work? After all, people have to be willing to share, and there has to be a way to find things to talk about in the first place. I was slightly skeptical going into the event, but ended up being pleasantly surprised.

### How it Worked
Three things made it work

- not using real names
- people's mindset/approach
- floating questions
- ability to move in and out of conversations

It was a room full of strangers

And then there were questions and topics floating around

- Group discussion on friendships in adulthood
- Diverse people (not the usual tech discussions)
- Interesting idea, alleviating the need for small talk
- Small talk is needed to pick out the topics for deeper exploration, but people resist

[^1]: I've only known Kat for a couple of months. We met at Slack HQ, where I gave [a short talk](http://nishanttotla.com/earth-tones-talk/#/). She reached out to me afterwards, we met up for dinner, and had an enjoyable conversation.
