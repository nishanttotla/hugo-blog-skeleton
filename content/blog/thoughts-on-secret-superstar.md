It's no secret that Bollywood movies are on an average pretty crass when it comes to social
commentary. There are always exceptions, but they're few and far between, so I'm always
excited when a movie comes along that pleasantly surprises me. Even more so when it's a major
blockbuster featuring a big star (this ensures wider reach). [Secret Superstar]() is one such
movie, starring newcomers? -daughter-, -mother-, and Aamir Khan.

Normally, I end up watching a lot of Indian movies (including Bollywood) because they offer
some level of familiarity and comfort which means a lot living far away from India. Most of
those movies offer little to write about though, but after watching Secret Superstar, I was
very motivated to do so, and not only because the movie nearly drove me to tears.
