I started posting these yearly review posts two years ago, and each time I've failed
to finish before the New Year's Eve. This time is no different. Regardless, I think
the effort is worthwhile and rewarding, especially for a cynical person like me who
often has a hard time appreciating the good things in life. Unlike the doom
and gloom of 2015 and 2016, my hindsight perception of 2017 is much more positive.

While I wouldn't say the year was smooth sailing all through, it has ended on a good note
for me because of some recent decisions. I have also been able to
be comfortable with myself at a level I never managed before. All of this is great news
and I cannot wait to take on new things in 2018, and continue some I started last year.

In no particular order, here's an incomplete list of highlights[^1]:

- First, the big one -- I [moved to San Francisco](/blog/moving-to-san-francisco/)! For a
while I had been feeling a lot of personal stagnation, and desperately wanted to move to
break out of it. There were many mixed feelings around this, with some positives and
negatives, but overall I'm proud I did it. I've hosted parties, collected artwork, and
created a space I feel good about. The move also shook me out of my physical lethargy,
and I found a new gym and trainer, which has done great things for my overall well-being.
I feel like I'm now moving past my usual sob story of physical injuries from old activities.

- In 2017, I started pursuing acting and other performance arts! I did a few [acting classes](/blog/about-acting-class/) and a clowning class at the Berkeley Repertory Theater, and engaged
with several artistic people and activities. This meant more shows, new friends, and
a variety of experiences I had sorely missed. This allowed me to channel my
creativity that trickled down into other parts of life. If you met me in person, maybe you
noticed I've been more freely expressive. While my attempts at auditioning for plays
bombed spectacularly, I ended the year with an open-mic performance that was described
by the organizer as the "sleeper hit of the night".

- Part of exercising the creative muscle for me was photography. I'm used to clicking
a lot of photos in general, but this year I spent much time thinking about them
also. For now, I've found my aesthetic, which could loosely be described as trying
to look for abstract moods in everyday scenes, in a somewhat post-impressionist
sense. I'm going to continue more of that this year now that I have bought a better
camera. Plus there's my [Instagram account about fire escapes](https://www.instagram.com/fireescapephotos/) that you want to follow.

- A common theme of much of my writing is Depression, which has troubled me for long
enough now that it feels like a part of my reality for as long as I can remember. I also
remember several false dawns when I thought I had overcome it, only to fall back
into familiar bad habits again. But, I've had significant
success in the last 2-3 months, and this time feels different.
I'd write more about it, but I'm choosing not to
because I'm avoiding this self-pity thing currently, plus we have a shitty culture
that trivializes mental health issues and judges those who dare to talk openly about them.
Ask me in person to know what's working for me currently.

- Being Depressed has side-effects™. The most troubling for me over time have been
related to socialization and personal relationships. Last year, I managed to get
into a better frame of mind wrt expectations from and responsibilities towards
friends, particularly old ones. I also got comfortable calling new people my close
friends, and that has been a significant boost for my happiness.

- In 2017, I experimented with my appearance. This included
coloring my hair and nails, and trying out more dressing styles than I'm normally used
to. In a certain sense, I've embraced my femininity and gotten more
comfortable about it. What has been a huge surprise though, is how much happier I
feel breaking gender norms, than sticking around with a limited range of behaviors
I was taught growing up.

- If I had to mark down one experience from the year as being the most memorable, it
would probably be [watching the total solar eclipse](/experiences/first-total-solar-eclipse/) back in August. A lot of effort went into making the
two minutes of totality possible, but it was packed with overwhelming emotion. I'd
do it all again in a heartbeat.

- I failed to meet my travel goal of visiting at least one new country every calendar
year[^2]. That was okay though, because I still managed a very memorable trip to
India in December (besides, exploring a new area of India is roughly the same
as visiting a new country right?). Overall, trips were shorter and less planned out. I often felt much less excitement about visiting places than in the past.
Among travels that stood out in the year:
  - Bangalore (January) for a meetup talk and some socializing.
  - New Orleans (March) to spend a few days submerged in good jazz.
  - Austin (April) where I spent a week for work and pleasure.
  - Zion and Bryce Canyon National Parks (May), where I hiked to the top of Angels Landing.
  - Yosemite National Park (June) to climb the Half Dome cables.
  - Acadia National Park (June) which was the furthest I've been north-east.
  - New York City (June) where I spent a few days working remotely and enjoying several shows (including a live taping of the Colbert show and seeing Trevor Noah and Laurie Metcalf up close!).
  - [Portland](/experiences/portland-july-2017/) (July) for the memorable bachelorette trip of a close friend.
  - Portland (August) again for the total solar eclipse. This included an Amtrak ride on the Coastal Starlight, and a backbreaking overnight drive back because we missed the return flight.
  - Sonoma County, California (September) for a hot air balloon ride!
  - Chicago (September) to visit a friend and explore magnificent architecture.
  - Moab and Arches National Park (October) for a couple of friends' bachelor trip.
  - Bikaner (December) for a wedding and a great time.
  - Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh (December) to visit some temples with family.

- I spent a lot of time exploring the city of San Francisco and its culture in depth, something I'd
never really done before. I enjoyed that a lot, and it strengthened my convictions
that I'm a city person through and through.

- Professionally, I continued working at Docker and gave a big talk at DockerCon 2017 in
Austin, Texas. Other than that, it was business as usual, even though I've been thinking hard and seriously about longer term professional goals.

In conclusion, I don't want to write much, but add that I ended [last year's post](/blog/2016-year-in-review/)
with "For too long now, life has felt like someone else in the driver's seat, and I want to end that". I'm grateful that this actually happened to a noticeable extent, so I am
looking forward to what comes my way in 2018.
