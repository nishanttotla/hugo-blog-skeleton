Lately, I've been exploring interesting neighborhoods in San Francisco by leisurely
walking through them. So far these jaunts have been focused on the Mission and Castro,
with the occasional venture into Haight-Ashbury or Hayes Valley. A couple of weeks
ago, I visited [Dijital Fix](https://dijitalfix.com/), an electronics+design store on
Valencia Street. It had some pretty retro electronics and other cool things. I clicked
this photo on the way out, and only later realized why I liked it so much.

I like to call it _Black Mirror_, for more than one reason. It literally is a black
colored mirror to begin with, so nothing special there. But for those familiar with
the TV show of the same name that is "centred around dark and satirical themes that
examine modern society, particularly with regard to the unanticipated consequences of
new technologies"[^1], there's more. As I hold up the phone to get a selfie, I'm putting
myself up for the world to see. But for the world, it's like watching a broadcast --
relevant one moment, forgotten the next. It's life and meaning for me, but a fleeting
moment for those flipping channels. On one of them, I'm On Air.
