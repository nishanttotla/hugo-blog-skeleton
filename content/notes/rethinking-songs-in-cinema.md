I was binge watching some music videos and at some point, [Dolna from Dil Toh Pagal Hai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWNkpJdkOj4) started playing. For no particular reason, it got me to wonder
what made me so happy when that song started playing. I thought well, the song has nostalgia value,
besides having two of the biggest superstars of my childhood, and sweet lyrics too. Then I started
to think about how I viewed these songs when I actually watched those movies several years ago, and
I'm pretty sure I hated the idea, thinking that the songs were distractions, and also the reason
Bollywood movies lagged behind Hollywood (same disclaimer about hollywood). Part of this was
just my male adolescence trying to be tough guy, but also a eurocentric view that made
western films better by default.

Anyway, so coming to the point. I think that as I've grown, moved to a different country, I've started
desiring a lot more engagement with desi content, and I think my view of desi movies as an art form
has shifted. This has also come from doing a lot of acting and clowning last year. The overacting SRK does, or that fancy group song and dance? That is art! In Batman, when something major is going down, there
is a party and conversations. In Bollywood, there was "Banke Tera Jogi". Bollywood is overdramatic
on average, but in as far as films depict a story, they can certainly choose to dramatise and abstract
as part of creative license.

I just want to go over this song Dolna. They're so abstract, and this song presumably comes right after
they admit their love for each other.
...

After that Kuch to Bata (Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani) started playing that turned my mood off with a
dance version of SRK ignoring consent of Juhi. So you know whatever.

>> disclaimer about bollywood being used to represent desi cinema. I grew up with it so I am only
talking about it.
