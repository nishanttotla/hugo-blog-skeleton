I work at caf√©s a lot, and like observing people. I try to not be creepy, but it's intriguing to note how people do things, imagine what they might be working on, or their story. One thing in particular I've always loved is to see the act of people packing their bags -- laptop, pens, glasses etc. It's weird, but recently I consciously realized this.

Then I noticed that I also like to watch hands writing, typing, or performing a number of other complex tasks that are really accessible only to human hands. I'm not sure why I'm sharing this, but is there anyone else out there who feels the same?
