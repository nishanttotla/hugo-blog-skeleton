### Articles
- [Beware Trivial Inconveniences](http://lesswrong.com/lw/f1/beware_trivial_inconveniences/) [LessWrong] -- This is a nice post about how The Great Firewall of China works by making it a little inconvenient and time-consuming to view subversive sites, thereby discouraging casual exploration. Even though it's easy to bypass it with little technical knowledge or instructions, most people don't do it. There are many more situations where it's easy to discourage people from doing certain things simply by making them slightly inconvenient.

### Music
- I attended my first **Anoushka Shankar** concert this week. Despite not having been a huge fan of her music in the past, I fell in love with the performance and the music. Perhaps my tastes are changing now. Music was from her new [Land of Gold album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVd3o9OuyxM&list=PLGjLVtehjLeV_z6twUDRKzDkJFhzYbXIV). Especially look out for the Secret Heart, Land to Nowhere, and Dissolving Boundaries tracks. The album is inspired by the pain and frustration of the recent refugee crisis, and reflects both anger and hope.

- Apart from that, [Abhinav](https://twitter.com/Equivalnce) introduced me to a couple of cool Coke Studio (Season 8) songs.

Umair Jaswal and Quratulain Balouch are amazing singers, and I particularly adore the flute and violins in this one.

This one is all about Ali Zafar. I always thought he was a good performer, but his vocal range and swagger are stunning.

For both the above, the videos are worth watching too!

- Yet another source of new music was [Bolly 92.3 FM](http://bolly923fm.com/), Bay Area's new Bollywood-only radio channel! I can't describe how glad I am to have this, even though a lot of modern Bollywood music is very forgettable.

### Miscellaneous
- [Slither](http://slither.io/) is an online multiplayer snake game, with 400-600 players on a board at any point of time. It's wildly addictive, and has been my second-most visited site behind Twitter.

- [Better Than Small Talk](http://www.betterthansmalltalk.com/#end-small-talk) was an experimental event I attended this week, where the focus was to create an atmosphere that encouraged people to quickly dive into deep conversations. It was interesting, and I've written more about it [here](/blog/better-than-small-talk).

- I started learning about online security and encryption, and wrote a couple of blog posts about it ([this](/blog/playing-with-keybase-io) and [this](/blog/signing-git-commits-gpg)).

Until next week!
