### Articles

- [Here Is The Powerful Letter The Stanford Victim Read Aloud To Her Attacker](https://www.buzzfeed.com/katiejmbaker/heres-the-powerful-letter-the-stanford-victim-read-to-her-ra?utm_term=.bwwlobVyk#.gsqJBEQDP) [BuzzFeed] -- An unconscious woman was raped by a 20 year old Stanford student behind a dumpster, and he was convicted but only got jail time of 6 months as punishment. This article is powerful, and has been evoking a lot of outrage over the awful treatment that rape victims are regularly subjected to, and the leniancy of the sentence. You've likely seen it shared everywhere.

- [The Medical Screenings All Men Need, and When](http://vitals.lifehacker.com/the-medical-screenings-all-men-need-and-when-1779846310) [Lifehacker] -- I've been considering figuring out a regular medical treatment plan (annual health checkup etc.) and this article seemed like a good starting point.

- [How "Silicon Valley" Nails Silicon Valley](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/how-silicon-valley-nails-silicon-valley) [The New Yorker] -- A lot of amazing behind the scenes info about how Silicon Valley (the show) is created. And in some cases, real life is even weirder than the show, even though the show is meant to be a caricature of the real thing.

- [Indians are never taught to talk to their parents as adults, and that’s a problem](https://www.buzzfeed.com/devangp/aavite-rovay-nai?utm_term=.wy3e0EKJo#.eiYYn8x4) [BuzzFeed] -- Continuing the series of some genuinely good articles on BuzzFeed, this one focuses on how interactions between Indian kids and parents are comically shallow on the emotional front, especially when the kids grow up. While this has not entirely been my experience, I can relate to some of it, and definitely have friends who can relate to all of it. It also appears that the original article appeared on a blog, then Reddit, then here, but I haven't tried to track down the source.

- [“But he does good work.”](https://medium.com/@violetblue/but-he-does-good-work-6710df9d9029#.uz90bya0k) [Medium] -- One of the stories behind Tor project evangelist Jacob Appelbaum and the sexual harassment and rape charges against him. It also touches upon the deep rooted culture in the tech that protects harassers. Violet Blue (the author) also reveals details about her interactions with Appelbaum in the past.

- [Counter-Advice for the PhD](http://jxyzabc.blogspot.com/2016/06/counter-advice-for-phd.html) [Jean Yang] -- A lot of successful academics give advice that doesn't make sense for those who are new or struggling, because they forget what it was actually like to be in that position. This post addresses some of that, and would have been very helpful had I read it at the start of my (failed) PhD.

- [The Lack of Options for (Startup Employees’) Options](http://a16z.com/2016/06/23/options-timing/) [Andreessen Horowitz] -- This post from the VC firm talks about how the 10 year exercise window doesn't make sense, and amounts to a "transfer" of wealth from newer employees to older ones who quit. It has been controversial this month, especially given that it does not provide any good alternative solutions.

- [10-Year Exercise Periods Make Sense](https://dangelo.quora.com/10-Year-Exercise-Periods-Make-Sense?share=1) [Quora] -- Adam D'Angelo, the co-founder and CEO of Quora responded to the above post, coming out in favor of the 10 year exercise window. Note that Quora was the first company to implement it.

### Music

- Masala Coffee is a band from Kerala. I don't know much about them, except that this cover is beautiful.

### Movies and TV Shows

- [Silicon Valley](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/) -- I first watched a bit of the show when it first came out, but didn't find it quite appealing. But after having worked at a software startup for a few months now, I can appreciate the satire and humor much better. It's crude, brash, over the top, and does a great job at making fun of the seemingly strange culture that pervades Silicon Valley. If you find an aspect of the show offensive or peculiar (eg. overt sexism, racism, conceit, etc.), then remember that the real thing is even weirder.

- [Citizenfour](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4044364/) -- A thrilling documentary about Edward Snowden's correspondence with the journalists who helped him break the story on government surveillance. It features all the real people involved.

- [Udta Punjab](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4434004/) -- A chilling movie about the drug menace that's supposed to be cripping the state of Punjab (India). It's one of the few Bollywood movies that doesn't sugar coat things, and presents a legitimately grim picture. Highly recommended, and glad it avoided most censorship.

### Miscellaneous

- [ShopSafe](https://www.bankofamerica.com/privacy/accounts-cards/shopsafe.go) -- Bank of America offers a program where you can create a temporary credit card online, that links to an existing card you own (one level of indirection). You can also set an expiry date and maximum (possibly recurring) limit on the card! This is extremely useful in places where you don't trust the vendor enough to provide your real credit card number. I'm going to use this extensively now.
