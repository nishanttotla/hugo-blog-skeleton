### Articles

- [The Glaring Blind Spot of the 'Me Too' Movement](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/11/the-glaring-blind-spot-of-the-me-too-movement/546458/) [The Atlantic] -- Quoting from the article, "Though the #MeToo movement has made clear the insidiousness and prevalence of sexual harassment and assault, it has also been centered mostly on the experiences of white, affluent, and educated women. One doesn’t need to look far to see instances of women of color being forgotten or sidelined." As much as we talk about intersectionality, we need to do better at applying it in practice when powerful movements like these take shape.

- [The Unforgiving Minute](https://longreads.com/2017/11/07/the-unforgiving-minute/) [Longreads] -- Laurie Penny expresses her anger and shares her point of view about what men can expect in the aftermath of #MeToo.

- [Thomas Pynchon Shows Us How White Writers Can Avoid Appropriation](https://electricliterature.com/thomas-pynchon-shows-us-how-white-writers-can-avoid-appropriation-8902a5563a1c) [Electric Literature] -- Thomas Pynchon wrote about the Herero people's genocide by German colonial
forces, the first "forgotten" genocide of the 20th century. The massacre is integral to two of his most famous novels, V. and Gravity’s Rainbow. As the article claims, he aws one of the few foreign (white) writers who wrote responsibly about an African country, while being conscious of his privilege as a white, male author, and used his privilege in order to tell a story that white history had buried. Of course, this is put into context with the culture and state of the world of the time, but it provides useful pointers for modern day writers on how to write responsibly about oppressed people. This will be increasingly important until we continue to struggle with proper representation in all areas.

- [Being A South Asian Lesbian In San Francisco Is Harder Than I Thought](https://www.fastcompany.com/40481445/being-a-south-asian-lesbian-in-san-francisco-is-harder-than-i-thought) [Fast Company] -- There is obviously much more to this story (and many more stories like these), but it goes towards shaking up what many people I know believe, that San Francisco is perfectly accepting and comforting for queer individuals of any identity.

- [When You're Queer And Undocumented, The DACA Stakes Are Higher](http://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/asian-queer-immigrant-daca_us_59b19e84e4b0b5e53104c574) [Huffington Post] -- For nearly any political decision, considering its impact on queer individuals reveals a lot of blind spots and avenues for marginalisation. The DACA repeal is no different.

- [Good Riddance to an Abusive Creep](https://next.currentaffairs.org/2017/09/good-riddance-to-an-abusive-creep) [Longreads] -- Hugh Hefner got a lot of praise in his obituaries for being the one to bring about a sexual revolution. But did he really deserve all that praise? Why did nobody talk about the fact that his was decidedly an anti-feminist movement and an abusive lifestyle. This article sheds some light on that.

- [The FBI’s Hunt for Two Missing Piglets Reveals the Federal Cover-Up of Barbaric Factory Farms](https://theintercept.com/2017/10/05/factory-farms-fbi-missing-piglets-animal-rights-glenn-greenwald/) [The Intercept] -- This is rather bizarre, and only shows how far the power of the factory farming industry goes in the US. This article is long, but it includes a good bit of history on animal rights activism as well.

- [California Just Became The First State To Recognize A Third Gender](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jtes/california-just-became-the-first-state-to-recognize-a-third?utm_term=.tpva2NMNv#.badA9MvMQ) [BuzzFeed] -- Progress and good news! This makes California the first state in the US to do so.

- [The first female senator was appointed 95 years ago. She was a white supremacist.](https://thelily.com/the-first-female-senator-was-appointed-95-years-ago-she-was-a-white-supremacist-69d21c2d214d) [The Lily] -- Rebecca Latimer Felton was the first (and to this date only) woman senator to come out of the state of Georgia. She is best remembered as a pioneering Georgia suffragette, writer and conservative advocate. What is notable about her though, is that she advocated for the lynching of black men, and was a self-avowed racist.[^1]

- [Being Black in Berlin](https://global.handelsblatt.com/politics/being-black-in-berlin-836253) [Handelsblatt Global] -- Regular Germans can be extremely racist. Is that surprising?

- [If women are not safe, a nation is not safe](https://theoutline.com/post/2555/if-women-are-not-safe-a-nation-is-not-safe) [The Outline] -- A solid thinkpiece that puts forward the idea that all the ills in the world are rooted in violence against women. I'd probably push this further to make it apply to oppression in general.

- [To Mend a Birth Defect, Surgeons Operate on the Patient Within the Patient](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/health/fetal-surgery-spina-bifida.html) [The New York Times] -- This is mind-blowingly impressive. Back in the 90s, my dad had written about this type of surgery becoming possible in the future, so this story carries personal significance.
