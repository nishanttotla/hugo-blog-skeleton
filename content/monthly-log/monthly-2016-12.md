There are some old posts here, just because I'm still catching up with the backlog
from the last 4-5 months.

### Articles

- [Five Trends Shaping India’s Voting Landscape](http://carnegieendowment.org/2013/09/10/five-trends-shaping-india-s-voting-landscape-pub-52870) [Carnegie Endowment] -- Interesting analysis of voting trends and factors affecting elections in India. It touches upon some numbers illustrating patterns around voter turnout, effect of state elections, translation of votes to seats, etc. This was written before the 2014 election though, so some of the analysis might have to be changed as a result. There are more interesting articles [here](http://carnegieendowment.org/specialprojects/IndiaDecides2014/).

- [Lego Marx](https://medium.com/@BigMeanInternet/lego-marx-de65004b8678#.ex51oew2g) [Medium] -- Follow up on links too, including [this](http://www.feministes-radicales.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/christine-delphy-a-materialist-feminism-is-possible.pdf).

- [Running in TrumpLand](http://thegauntlife.blogspot.com/2016/12/running-in-trumpland.html) [The Gaunt Life] -- Sam Robinson is a long-distance runner who lives in the Bay Area. He grew up in the rural mid-west, and describes the transformation of the places he knew when young, to what they've become now. This is a particularly good read in the light of the recent election, and a rare perspective of someone who has actually seen and lived through the "ignored rust belt".

- [Intake](https://www.buzzfeed.com/rosalindadams/intake?utm_term=.nyQ9MWJ3X#.vc4jEAg5G) [BuzzFeed] -- This is a long investigative piece.

This came up in my feed again as Jayalalithaa died earlier this month, and is a fascinating read.

### Travel

- Tokyo, Japan -- I finally took some vacation days and traveled to a new country for the year.

### Miscellaneous

- Netmag article

- [The School of Life YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/schooloflifechannel/videos) -- A series of eclectic and interesting short videos on various philosophical topics.

- [](http://www.alison-jackson.co.uk/) --

- [](https://anchoreditions.com/blog/dorothea-lange-censored-photographs) --

- [Don't Be a Sucker - 1947](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23X14HS4gLk) --  The US Military produced this anti-fascist film the wake of WWII. It deconstructs the [sic] politically motivated social engineering of Germany by the Nazi regime. Pretty relevant today, and a sad reminder of how much the US has regressed in the time.
