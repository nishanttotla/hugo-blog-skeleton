There are some old posts here, just because I'm still catching up with the backlog
from the last 4-5 months.

### Articles

- [Five Trends Shaping India’s Voting Landscape](http://carnegieendowment.org/2013/09/10/five-trends-shaping-india-s-voting-landscape-pub-52870) [Carnegie Endowment] -- Interesting analysis of voting trends and factors affecting elections in India. It touches upon some numbers illustrating patterns around voter turnout, effect of state elections, translation of votes to seats, etc. This was written before the 2014 election though, so some of the analysis might have to be changed as a result. There are more interesting articles [here](http://carnegieendowment.org/specialprojects/IndiaDecides2014/).

- [Lego Marx](https://medium.com/@BigMeanInternet/lego-marx-de65004b8678#.ex51oew2g) [Medium] -- This is a great read because it refines and describes very clearly the combination of intersectionality and Marxism. It talks about "materialism" as the scientific method which can be used to describe various class conflicts in the Marxism mould. It has influenced my thinking a lot recently. The article also cites an essay from the late-70s by French women’s liberation theorist Christine Delphy called [“A Materialist Feminism is possible”](http://www.feministes-radicales.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/christine-delphy-a-materialist-feminism-is-possible.pdf) as inspiration.

- [Running in TrumpLand](http://thegauntlife.blogspot.com/2016/12/running-in-trumpland.html) [The Gaunt Life] -- Sam Robinson is a long-distance runner who lives in the Bay Area. He grew up in the rural mid-west, and describes the transformation of the places he knew when young, to what they've become now. This is a particularly good read in the light of the recent election, and a rare perspective of someone who has actually seen and lived through the "ignored rust belt".


- [What Happens When a State Is Run by Movie Stars?](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/05/magazine/what-happens-when-a-state-is-run-by-movie-stars.html) [The New York Times Magazine] -- An old article from last year that describes the fanatical politics of Tamil Nadu. This came up in my feed again as Jayalalithaa died earlier this month, and is a fascinating read.

- [I Was a Proud Non-Breeder. Then I Changed My Mind.](http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/05/i-was-a-proud-non-breeder-i-changed-my-mind.html) [The Cut] -- Article from a journalist who had vowed to be child-free at 27 but found herself changing her mind later (for her own reasons). She explains her reasons in this post. To quote from the article "Not long ago, I learned the Arabic word Ya’aburnee from a friend’s cheesy Facebook graphic. Literally, “you bury me,” it means wanting to die before a loved one so as not to have to face the world without him or her in it. It’s a word that captures exactly my feeling for my husband. Part of the reason I didn’t want kids was because I feared they’d come between us, but if he were gone, I’d be frantic to hold on to a piece of him. Grasping this didn’t make me want a baby, exactly, but it started pushing me from “no” to, well, ambivalent."

- [The movie that doesn’t exist and the Redditors who think it does](http://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/internet/2016/12/movie-doesn-t-exist-and-redditors-who-think-it-does) [NewStatesman] -- Over the years, hundreds of people online have shared memories of a cheesy nineties movie called “Shazaam”. There is no evidence that such a film was ever made. This article talks about the quirks of collective memory. There's also a subreddit that abounds in things like these: [/r/MandelaEffect](https://www.reddit.com/r/MandelaEffect/).

### Music

- Dilruba Na Raazi -- [Avradeep](https://www.facebook.com/avradeep.bhowmik/) introduced me to this song recently, calling it an earworm. He was right!

### Travel

- Tokyo, Japan -- I finally took some vacation days and traveled to a new country for the year.

### Miscellaneous

- [All the Flight Deals](https://alltheflightdeals.com) -- I'm always on the lookout for new innovative attempts to find cheap flight deals. This new one came up on my feed, and the UX is designed to show the cheapest tickets out of an airport to *anywhere* in the world. Useful when you want to plan a vacation based on ticket availability. There are some more features as well.

- [Indivisible: A Practical Guide For Resisting the Trump Agenda](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/) -- A really comprehensive collection of information where former congressional staffers reveal best practices for making Congress listen. This is in response to the urgent to form a front against the racist and bigoted agenda of the incoming administration. This originally started out as a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DzOz3Y6D8g_MNXHNMJYAz1b41_cn535aU5UsN7Lj8X8/mobilebasic). There's also a [New Yorker article](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-crowd-sourced-guide-to-fighting-trumps-agenda) describing the story behind it.

- I wrote a short Docker tutorial for [Netmag](http://www.creativebloq.com/net-magazine), a UK magazine. This is the first time I've done something like this, and I'm pretty excited! The issue goes on sale in late January.

- [The School of Life YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/schooloflifechannel/videos) -- A series of eclectic and interesting short videos on various philosophical topics. The perfect content for watching during breakfast.

- [Alison Jackson](http://www.alison-jackson.co.uk/) -- Alison Jackson is a British artist, and some of her art portrays the "intimate, often salacious, imagined private moments of media icons". These aren't real images, but very intriguing.

- [Dorothea Lange’s Censored Photographs of FDR’s Japanese Concentration Camps](https://anchoreditions.com/blog/dorothea-lange-censored-photographs) -- Dorothea Lange was hired by the U.S. government to make a photographic record of the "evacuation" and "relocation" of Japanese-Americans in 1942. She was eager to take the commission, despite being opposed to the effort, as she believed "a true record of the evacuation would be valuable in the future."



- [Don't Be a Sucker - 1947](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23X14HS4gLk) --  The US Military produced this anti-fascist film the wake of WWII. It deconstructs the [sic] politically motivated social engineering of Germany by the Nazi regime. Pretty relevant today, and a sad reminder of how much the US has regressed in the time.

- [/r/churning](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/) -- I recently learned of this subreddit for learning more about hacking credit card rewards.
