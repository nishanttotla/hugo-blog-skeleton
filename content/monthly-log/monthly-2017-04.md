### Articles

- [The Fighter](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/magazine/afghanistan-soldier-ptsd-the-fighter.html) [The New York Times Magazine] -- Pulitzer Prize winning story about US Marine Sam Siatta's traumatic experiences while serving in Afghanistan, and difficulties reintegrating into social life after coming back. It's a long and powerful read.

- [When Pixels Collide](http://sudoscript.com/reddit-place/) [sudoscript] -- For April Fool's Day this year, Reddit launched an experiment, giving all its users a blank canvas called Place. Each user could place a pixel (out of 16 colors) anywhere on the canvas as many times as they wanted, waiting a few minutes between each time. This article delves into the fascinating patterns that showed up while the experiment ran.

- [The forgotten history of how automakers invented the crime of "jaywalking"](http://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7551873/jaywalking-history) [Vox] -- TL;DR: Lobbying runs America.

- [The Syria Catastrophe](https://nplusonemag.com/issue-28/politics/the-syria-catastrophe-2/) [n+1 Magazine] -- A long and comprehensive look (one of many out there) at the crisis in Syria, with the added emphasis that everyone needs to first agree that "anti-war" is the way to go if we're going to stop the humanitarian crisis. This is particularly relevant because most entities in the war have agendas that are built upon blaming other entities.[^1]

- [The Physics of Forbidden Love](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/style/modern-love-the-physics-of-forbidden-love.html) [The New York Times] -- I'm a fan of the Modern Love column on NYT. While I never include these columns in my monthly logs, I chose to break that rule because of the several fronts on which this story struck a chord.

### Travel

- Austin, Texas -- I spent a week in Austin, traveling for a conference where I also gave a technical talk for an audience of several hundred people. I didn't get a chance to explore too much of the city, but whatever little I did, I was surprised by how much I liked it.

### Music

- More [Thaikkudam Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaikkudam_Bridge) after last month. A bluesy version of the popular "Inteha" song.

- Amit Trivedi is one of the best musicians in Bollywood right now. He performed some of his best compositions with a group of artists at the Royal Stag Mirchi Music Awards. It's a nice video to watch if you're a fan.

### Miscellaneous

- [81 Awesome Mental Health Resources When You Canâ€™t Afford a Therapist](http://greatist.com/grow/resources-when-you-can-not-afford-therapy) -- Access to therapy, and especially good therapy is hard. This is a good list of resources (though I haven't vetted the entire list and certainly haven't tried most of the options), and worth sharing just in case it helps someone.

- [USA Facts](https://www.usafacts.org/) and [Data USA](https://datausa.io) -- These are separate collaborative efforts to help search for and visualize data related to critical aspects of America such as health, education, jobs, etc. Try them out.

- I joined a beginner acting class at the Berkeley Repertory Theater. I'm glad to be finally doing this after wanting to try acting for years!
