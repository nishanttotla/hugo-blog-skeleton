### Articles

- [The Uninhabitable Earth](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans.html) [NYMag] -- A comprehensive look at the worst-case scenarios resulting from climate change in the coming decades. This article
is decidedly alarmist, but deliberately so. As climate change denial becomes more common,
it argues that an alarmist approach is required to counter it, especially as climate scientists continue to be cautious about long term effects. On a related note, there
was another [climate change article in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/07/13/climate/climate-change-make-a-difference-quiz.html) this month.

- [San Francisco is Burning](http://www.gq.com/story/san-francisco-is-burning) [GQ] -- An investigation into mysterious fires in the Mission neighborhood of San Francisco that have left people wondering if landlords are using arson to drive out low-income tenants. It went viral this month, leading to this [counter article](https://modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/gqs-san-francisco-burning-story-massive-troll-some-shoddy-reporting) from a local journalist who claimed that the GQ article is bad journalism.

- [The battle against caste isn't just some ideology, it's our existence](http://roundtableindia.co.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7743:the-battle-against-caste-is-not-some-ideology-it-is-our-existence&catid=119:feature&Itemid=132) [Round Table India] -- This article has personal significance for me because it's written by someone who grew up in the same city I did. Gaurav Somwanshi writes about the status of Dalit literature and its availability, and how it compares with more "mainstream" literature. He also talks about what it means for the long battle against caste.

- [How Doctors Take Women's Pain Less Seriously](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/emergency-room-wait-times-sexism/410515/) [The Atlantic] -- An unnerving story about a woman who came close to dying because doctors didn't think her complaints about her pain warranted immediate attention. With this story as a backdrop, the author explores whether the medical system overall assigns less weight to women's pain and health issues.

- [How bosses are (literally) like dictators](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/7/17/15973478/bosses-dictators-workplace-rights-free-markets-unions) [Vox] -- As many Americans (libertarians in particular) complain about the overreach of government into their lives, they forget to look at how private enterprises have taken over our lives in ways significant enough to consider them a form of shadow government -- only with much less oversight and lack of legal protection for many workers. I recommend this to anyone who considers that worker-protection laws are not needed. Elizabeth Anderson (the author) has also written [an entire book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32889465-private-government) exploring these ideas.

### Books

In my current acting class, we're working on two plays.

- [Gruesome Playground Injuries](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16100483-gruesome-playground-injuries) -- This is a short play about two people Doug and Kayleen as the go through their complicated lives from ages eight to thirty-eight. It's interesting not only because these are complex characters, but also because the same actors are required to act all ages in the play.

- [Maple and Vine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13733413-maple-and-vine) -- What happens when a modern city couple somehow ends up in a cult which is all about recreating the 50s American suburban lifestyle? This is an intriguing play because it explores ideas of choice, mental health, queerness, gender roles, and racism in a contrast between now and the 50s.

### Movies and TV Shows

- [The Birth of a Nation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4196450/) -- The story of Nat Turner, a literate slave and preacher in the antebellum South, who orchestrated a rebellion against
slave owners.

- [Rise of the Planet of the Apes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1318514) -- One of the best origin story science fiction movies I've watched so far. It was gripping from start to finish.

- [Dawn of the Planet of the Apes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2103281) -- I watched the sequel soon after the original. While it wasn't as good as the first one, it advanced the franchise and I'm excited for the third installment which released this year.

### Travel

- [Portland](/experiences/portland-july-2017) -- I spent three days in Portland eating a lot of really good food.

### Miscellaneous

- [Hindustan Times Hate Tracker](http://www.hindustantimes.com/hate-tracker) -- One of the first hate crime tracking databases in India (AFAIK) that focuses on identity-based crimes. With caste, religion, and gender based violence seemingly on the rise, tracking is an important part of the process of dealing with it.

- [Pictures: Mysterious Deep-Sea Life Below Antarctica](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/proof/2017/06/under-antarctica-behind-scenes-photo/) -- One word: stunning. "The waters under Antarctic ice are like Mount Everest: magical, but so hostile that you have to be sure of your desire before you go," said Laurent Ballesta, the photographer.

- [No One Would Buy My Photos, So Here They Are For Free: Mosul 2017](https://petapixel.com/2017/07/05/no-one-buy-photos-free-mosul-2017/) -- A photographer shared their war photos for free. There has been some discussion around the ethics and implications of this. I haven't had the time to read it yet, but the photos are intense.

- [Ep 4. Meet the Transgender Swim Star Who's Earned a Spot on the Men's Team](https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/playback/identify/identify/meet-the-transgender-swim-star-whos-earned-a-spot-on-the-mens-team/) -- On the Olympic Channel, there are some good personal stories of Transgender athletes who have managed to overcome hurdles to make it to the top of their sport.
